# Functions

## Overview
• Functions

• Parameters

• Return Values

### Functions
• The best way to solve a complicated problem is to break it down to smaller problems.

• Functions allow us to break a complicated algorithm into smaller algorithms.

• Let’s create the simplest form of a function and explore how it can reduce the amount of code we have to write.

### Parameters
• The previous shown version of function is incredibly useful, however it’s quite limited, as it can only execute 
the code that is written in it, exactly how it’s written.

• What about if we want to pass in a different string to print, a different number to use in a calculation?
Parameters are the answers!

### Return Values
• Function cannot only accept values through parameters, they can also return a variable, but only a single variable!
• In most cases, a function should be constructed so that it can be reused elsewhere in the program, or even in other
programs (not always - but generally a good rule of thumb)
